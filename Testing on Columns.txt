Churn prediction (either "Churn" or "Not churn" based on the model's predicted probability threshold)
After obtaining the churn probability for each customer using the testing data, you can apply 
a threshold to classify them as churners or non-churners. 
For example, if the churn probability is above 0.5, you classify the customer as a churner; 
otherwise, you classify them as a non-churner. 
This threshold can be adjusted based on the specific requirements and performance of the model.
